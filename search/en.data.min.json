As we are using webpack as pre-processor, the normal version of Hugo is sufficient. If you prefer the extended version of Hugo anyway this will work as well. For comprehensive Hugo documentation, see gohugo.io.\nIf you want to use the theme from a cloned branch instead of a release tarball you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install webpack locally and run the build script once to create all required assets.\n# install required packages from package.json npm install # run the build script to build required assets npm run build # build release tarball npm run pack Using the theme To prepare your new site environment just a few steps are required:\nCreate a new empty Hugo site.\nhugo new site demosite Switch to the root of the new site.\ncd demosite Install the Geekdoc theme from a release bundle (recommended) or from Git branch.\nCreate the minimal required Hugo configuration config.toml. For all configuration options take a look at the configuration page.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;http://localhost\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Geekdocs\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34; pluralizeListTitles = false # Geekdoc required configuration pygmentsUseClasses = true pygmentsCodeFences = true disablePathToLower = true # Required if you want to render robots.txt template enableRobotsTXT = true # Needed for mermaid shortcodes [markup] [markup.goldmark.renderer] # Needed for mermaid shortcode unsafe = true [markup.tableOfContents] startLevel = 1 endLevel = 9 [taxonomies] tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; Test your site.\nhugo server -D Option 1: Download pre-build release bundle Download and extract the latest release bundle into the theme directory.\nmkdir -p themes/hugo-geekdoc/ curl -L https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc/releases/latest/download/hugo-geekdoc.tar.gz | tar -xz -C themes/hugo-geekdoc/ --strip-components=1 Option 2: Clone the GitHub repository Info\nKeep in mind this method is not recommended and needs some extra steps to get it working. If you want to use the Theme as submodule keep in mind that your build process need to run the described steps as well. Clone the Geekdoc git repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc.git themes/hugo-geekdoc Build required theme assets e.g. CSS files and SVG sprites.\nnpm install npm run build Deployments Netlify There are several ways to deploy your site with this theme on Netlify. Regardless of which solution you choose, the main goal is to ensure that the prebuilt theme release tarball is used or to run the required commands to prepare the theme assets before running the Hugo build command.\nHere are some possible solutions:\nUse a Makefile:\nAdd a Makefile to your repository to bundle the required steps.\nTHEME_VERSION := v0.8.2 THEME := hugo-geekdoc BASEDIR := docs THEMEDIR := $(BASEDIR)/themes .PHONY: doc doc: doc-assets doc-build .PHONY: doc-assets doc-assets: mkdir -p $(THEMEDIR)/$(THEME)/ ; \\ curl -sSL \u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/$(THEME)/releases/download/${THEME_VERSION}/$(THEME).tar.gz\u0026#34; | tar -xz -C $(THEMEDIR)/$(THEME)/ --strip-components=1 .PHONY: doc-build doc-build: cd $(BASEDIR); hugo .PHONY: clean clean: rm -rf $(THEMEDIR) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf $(BASEDIR)/public This Makefile can be used in your netlify.toml, take a look at the Netlify example for more information:\n[build] publish = \u0026#34;docs/public\u0026#34; command = \u0026#34;make doc\u0026#34; Chain required commands:\nChain all required commands to prepare the theme and build your site on the command option in your netlify.toml like this:\n[build] publish = \u0026#34;docs/public\u0026#34; command = \u0026#34;command1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; command 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; command3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo\u0026#34; Subdirectories Warning\nAs deploying Hugo sites on subdirectories is not as robust as on subdomains, we do not recommend this. If you have a choice, using a domain/subdomain should always be the preferred solution! If you want to deploy your site to a subdirectory of your domain, some extra steps are required:\nConfigure your Hugo base URL e.g. baseURL = http://localhost/demo/. Don\u0026rsquo;t use relativeURLs: false nor canonifyURLs: true as is can cause unwanted side effects! There are two ways to get Markdown links or images working:\nUse the absolute path including your subdirectory e.g. [testlink](/demo/example-site) Overwrite the HTML base in your site configuration with geekdocOverwriteHTMLBase = true and use the relative path e.g. [testlink](example-site) But there is another special case if you use geekdocOverwriteHTMLBase = true. If you use anchors in your Markdown links you have to ensure to always include the page path. As an example [testlink](#some-anchor) will resolve to http://localhost/demo/#some-anchor and not automatically include the current page!\nKnown Limitations Minify HTML results in spacing issues Using hugo --minify without further configuration or using other minify tools that also minify HTML files might result in spacing issues in the theme and is not supported.\nAfter some testing we decided to not spend effort to fix this issue for now as the benefit is very low. There are some parts of the theme where spaces between HTML elements matters but were stripped by minify tools. Some of these issues are related to gohugoio/hugo#6892. While recommendation like \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t depend on whitespace in your layout\u0026rdquo; sounds reasonable, it seems to be not that straight forward especially for something like embedded icons into the text flow.\nIf you still want to use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s minify flag you should at least exclude HTML file in your site configuration:\n[minify] disableHTML = true ","description":"This page tells you how to get started with the Geekdoc theme, including installation and basic configuration.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/usage/","title":"Usage","parent":"Welcome to the documentation","content":"","description":""},{"id":2,"href":"/electronic-product/yeelight/","title":"Yeelight","parent":"电子产品","content":"","description":""},{"id":3,"href":"/electronic-product/","title":"电子产品","parent":"Welcome to the documentation","content":"","description":""},{"id":4,"href":"/usage/configuration/","title":"Configuration","parent":"Usage","content":" Site configuration Page configuration Site configuration TOML baseURL = \u0026#34;http://localhost\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Geekdocs\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34; # Required to get well formatted code blocks pygmentsUseClasses = true pygmentsCodeFences = true disablePathToLower = true enableGitInfo = true # Required if you want to render robots.txt template enableRobotsTXT = true [markup] [markup.goldmark.renderer] # Needed for mermaid shortcode unsafe = true [markup.tableOfContents] startLevel = 1 endLevel = 9 [taxonomies] tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; [params] # (Optional, default 6) Set how many table of contents levels to be showed on page. # Use false to hide ToC, note that 0 will default to 6 (https://gohugo.io/functions/default/) # You can also specify this parameter per page in front matter. geekdocToC = 3 # (Optional, default static/brand.svg) Set the path to a logo for the Geekdoc # relative to your \u0026#39;static/\u0026#39; folder. geekdocLogo = \u0026#34;logo.png\u0026#34; # (Optional, default false) Render menu from data file in \u0026#39;data/menu/main.yaml\u0026#39;. # See also https://geekdocs.de/usage/menus/#bundle-menu. geekdocMenuBundle = true # (Optional, default false) Collapse all menu entries, can not be overwritten # per page if enabled.

File-tree menu is the default one and does not require further configuration to work. If you want full control about your menu the bundle menu is a powerful option to accomplish it.\nFile-tree menu Bundle menu More menu Extra Header Menu File-tree menu As the name already suggests, the file tree menu builds a menu from the file system structure of the content folder. By default, areas and subareas are sorted alphabetically by the title of the pages. To manipulate the order the weight parameter in a page front matter can be used. To structure your content folder you have to use page bundles, single files are not supported. Hugo will render build single files in the content folder just fine but it will not be added to the menu.\nExample:\nFile system structure:\ncontent/ ├── level-1 │ ├── _index.md │ ├── level-1-1.md │ ├── level-1-2.md │ └── level-1-3 │ ├── _index.md │ └── level-1-3-1.md └── level-2 ├── _index.md ├── level-2-1.md └── level-2-2.md Bundle menu This type of navigation needs to be enabled first by setting geekdocMenuBundle to true in your site configuration. After you have activated the bundle menu, you start with an empty navigation. This is intentional because bundle menus have to be defined manually in a data file. While this increases the effort it also offers maximum flexibility in the design. The data file needs to be written in YAML and placed at data/menu/main.yaml.\nExample:\n--- main: - name: Level 1 ref: \u0026#34;/level-1\u0026#34; icon: \u0026#34;gdoc_notification\u0026#34; sub: - name: Level 1.1 ref: \u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-1\u0026#34; - name: Level 1.2 ref: \u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-2\u0026#34; - name: Level 1.3 ref: \u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-3\u0026#34; sub: - name: Level 1.3.1 ref: \u0026#34;/level-1/level-1-3/level-1-3-1\u0026#34; - name: Level 2 ref: \u0026#34;/level-2\u0026#34; sub: - name: Level 2.1 ref: \u0026#34;/level-2/level-2-1\u0026#34; - name: Level 2.2 ref: \u0026#34;/level-2/level-2-2\u0026#34; - name: Level 2.2 Anchor ref: /level-2/level-2-2 # Anchor to add to the entry. This example will result in `/level-2/level-2-2/#anchor` anchor: anchor As an advantage you can add icons to your menu entries e.g. icon: \u0026quot;gdoc_notification\u0026quot;.\nMore menu Tip\nThe more menu is special type of the bundle menu and can be combined with the default file-tree menu. As this is a special type of the bundle menu it is basically working in the same way. To enable it just add a data file to data/menu/more.yaml. The more menu will also work with the file-tree menu and therefor don\u0026rsquo;t need to be enabled by the geekdocMenuBundle parameter.\nExample:\n--- more: - name: News ref: \u0026#34;/#\u0026#34; icon: \u0026#34;gdoc_notification\u0026#34; - name: Releases ref: \u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc/releases\u0026#34; external: true icon: \u0026#34;gdoc_download\u0026#34; - name: \u0026#34;View Source\u0026#34; ref: \u0026#34;https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc\u0026#34; external: true icon: \u0026#34;gdoc_github\u0026#34; Extra Header Menu If you want to customize the header menu, this can be achieved by using a data file written in YAML and placed at data/menu/extra.yaml.\nExample:\n--- header: - name: GitHub ref: https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc icon: gdoc_github external: true ","description":"The theme supports two different kinds of menus. File-tree menu is the default one and does not require further configuration to work. If you want full control about your menu the bundle menu is a powerful option to accomplish it.\nFile-tree menu Bundle menu More menu Extra Header Menu File-tree menu As the name already suggests, the file tree menu builds a menu from the file system structure of the content folder."},{"id":6,"href":"/electronic-product/yeelight/1s/","title":"Smart LED Bulb 1S User Manual","parent":"Yeelight","content":" PAGE A PAGE B PAGE A PAGE B ","description":" PAGE A PAGE B PAGE A PAGE B "},{"id":7,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Welcome to the documentation","content":"","description":""},{"id":8,"href":"/","title":"Welcome to the documentation","parent":"","content":" Geekdoc is a simple Hugo theme for documentations.
